1. Save Your Changes

    Save any work you’re editing in your code editor.

2. Check Git Status

git status

    This shows your current changes and helps avoid surprises.

3. Stash or Commit Changes

Option 1: Commit Your Changes

git add .
git commit -m "Save current work"

    This permanently saves your changes in your local repository.

Option 2: Stash Your Changes (if you’re not ready to commit)

git stash

    This temporarily saves your changes and clears your working directory.

4. Pull the Latest Changes

git pull origin <branch_name>

    Replace <branch_name> with your current branch, typically main or master.

5. Restore Stashed Changes (if used)

git stash pop

    This reapplies your saved changes and may trigger a conflict if the same files were modified remotely.

6. Resolve Any Conflicts (if needed)

    Open the files with conflicts, look for <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> markers.
    Decide which changes to keep, then save and commit the resolved files.
